### Summary

For our project we will be focusing our analysis on datasets from Twitter and news forums/sites to perform sentiment analysis (using NLP models) on these datasets and infer any impact on stock and crypto prices for the following list of assets: AAPL, TSLA, TWTR, BTC, ETH, DOGE. 

### Project Details

For our dataset we are referring to CSV databanks from Kaggle. The dataset periods will be for 2019 - 2022. For the sentiment analysis we will be using NLTK and for data wrangling and clean up we will be using NUMPY, PANDAS and other relevant python libraries. Once we have the models trained we will use scikit learn, tensorflow and time series to create a prediction model for these assets based on the sentiment analysis. Finally we will integrate our models to create a roboadvisor using AWS Lex1 and Sagemaker.
